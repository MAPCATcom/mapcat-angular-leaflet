FAQ
--------------

### What are we doing exactly?

This project is a seed project that can help you get started with building leaflet applications on Angular2 using terkepem.hu map layers.

### Type definition

Leaflet doesn't come bundled as a typed library and for that reason, we install the type definitions from @type/leaflet that contains its type definitions. This type definition is required
to use leaflet with typescript. Running `npm install` will take care of this for you.

### What is the workflow like?

This project uses an npm based work flow for installing, running and building the application.
